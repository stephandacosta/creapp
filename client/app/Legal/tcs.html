The  one exception to the exclusivity of arbitration is that you have the right to  bring an individual claim against the Company in a small-claims court of  competent jurisdiction. But whether you choose arbitration or small-claims  court, you may not under any circumstances commence or maintain against the  Company any class action, class arbitration, or other representative action or  proceeding.</p><p>  By using the Website or the Service in any manner, you agree to the above arbitration agreement.

Your rights will be determined by  a&nbsp;<b>NEUTRAL ARBITRATOR, NOT A JUDGE OR JURY</b>. You are entitled to a  fair hearing before the arbitrator. The arbitrator can grant any relief that a  court can, but you should note that arbitration proceedings are usually simpler  and more streamlined than trials and other judicial proceedings. Decisions by  the arbitrator are enforceable in court and may be overturned by a court only  for very limited reasons.</p><ol>  <li>Any proceeding to enforce this arbitration      agreement, including any proceeding to confirm, modify, or vacate an      arbitration award, may be commenced in any court of competent      jurisdiction. In the event that this arbitration agreement is for any      reason held to be unenforceable, any litigation against the Company      (except for small-claims court actions) may be commenced only in the      federal or state courts located in Dallas County, Texas. You hereby      irrevocably consent to the jurisdiction of those courts for such      purposes.  </li>  <li>    This Agreement, and any dispute between you and    the Company, shall be governed by the laws of the state of Texas without    regard to principles of conflicts of law, provided that this arbitration    agreement shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act.  </li> </ol><li>  <h2>Indemnity by You.</h2>  <p>    You agree to indemnify and hold the Company, its subsidiaries, and affiliates, and its    and their officers, agents, partners and employees, harmless from any loss,    liability, claim, or demand, including reasonable attorney's fees, made by any    third party due to or arising out of your breach of or failure to comply with    this Agreement (including any breach of your representations and warranties    contained herein), any Publishing or content you publish on the Website or as a    result of the Service, and the violation of any law or regulation by you.

You agree that you are deemed  to have received any and all notices that would have been delivered had you  accessed the Service in an authorized manner.</p><li>  <h2>Entire Agreement; Other.</h2></li><p>  This Agreement, with the Privacy Policy and any specific guidelines or rules that  are separately published for particular services or offers on the Website,  contains the entire agreement between you and the Company regarding the use of  the Website and/or the Service. If any provision of this Agreement is held  invalid, the remainder of this Agreement shall continue in full force and  effect. The failure of the Company to exercise or enforce any right or  provision of this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of such right or  provision. You agree that your online account is non-transferable and all of  your rights to your profile or contents within your account terminate upon your  death. No agency, partnership, joint venture or employment is created as a  result of this Agreement and you may not make any representations or bind the  Company in any manner.</p><li>  <h2>Amendment.</h2>  <p>    This Agreement is subject to change by the Company at any time. The revised terms will be effective upon    Publishing on the Website and your use of the Service after such Publishing    will constitute acceptance by you of the revised Agreement.  </p></li><br><br><p>Please contact us by email at <a href="mailto:customer.service@creapp.us?Subject=TCS" target="_top">customer.service@creapp.us</a> with any questions regarding this agreement.</p>
